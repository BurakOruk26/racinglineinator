This repository aims to calculate the ideal racing line of any given track. Ways of achieving this will be discussed below.

## Methods
1. Using instance segmentation on satellite imagery to draw the racing track.
2. Doing normalization on the obtained data to achieve the best results.
3. Doing mathematical calculations -as explained in the paper- to find the racing line.

## Research Paper
As of now, the paper is not published.
